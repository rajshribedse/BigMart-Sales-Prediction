# BigMart-Sales-Prediction

## Objective
The objective of this project is to predict sales revenue for different products using a **Random Forest Regressor** model. The insights gained will help businesses optimize inventory management and marketing strategies.

---

## Features
- Predict sales revenue based on multiple features like product type, outlet size, and location.
- Leverage Random Forest Regressor for accurate and interpretable predictions.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and insights.

---
## Workflow
1. **Data Collection**  
   Collect the dataset containing product and outlet details along with historical sales.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values and outliers.  
   - Encode categorical variables using techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.  
   - Engineer new features to improve model performance.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize relationships between features and sales.  
   - Identify trends using graphs and plots.

4. **Model Training**  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  
   - Train the Random Forest Regressor on the training data.

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   Evaluate the model on the test dataset using metrics like:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)  
   - R-squared (RÂ²)  

6. **Prediction**  
   Use the trained model to predict sales for unseen data.
